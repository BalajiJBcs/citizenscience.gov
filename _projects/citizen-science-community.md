## About the Community
The growing Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Community of Practice (CCS) represents a group of hundreds of federal employees representing 35 agencies who meet regularly to share lessons learned and develop best practices for crowdsourcing and citizen science. 

A second, overlapping community is the citizen science agency coordinators that were appointed as a result of OSTPâ€™s 2015 memo, Addressing Societal and Scientific Challenges through Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing.
